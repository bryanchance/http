HTTP Libraries

HTTP server, client, tests, and examples.  All required repositories
are included as submodules so if you clone with --recursive you should
have everything you need for building.

When using Open Dylan 2011.1 or earlier, add http/registry to the
OPEN_DYLAN_USER_REGISTRIES environment variable before building.
